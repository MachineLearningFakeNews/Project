FOX News Greg Gutfeld Introduces New Sponsor Of His ShowVictima [VIDEO],['Fed Up'],2017-05-20 23:25:56+00:00,"At the start of the Fox News Greg Gutfeld Show, Gutfeld showed a hilarious clip mocking the hysteria of the Democrat Party. Gutfeld began his show by telling his viewers, Im really excited to introduce a new sponsor to our show. Its a new drug. Its called Victima' Gutfeld went on to explain that the drug was created to help Democrats who are feeling defeated after the brutal election of Donald Trump cope: When identity politics no longer work, try Victima. Americas been witnessing the embarrassing meltdown of liberals ever since President Trump shocked the world with his stinging defeat of Crooked Hillary, so Gutfeld decided to have a little fun by mocking the embarrassing behavior of the left. The voice in the commercial mimics the typical TV drug commercials with sappy music playing in the background: Its not what it used to be. It used to be fine.The Democratic Partyits not performong.Its slow, sluggish, confused, prone to fits of despair. It may be time for Victima. Victims, when your old identity politics no longer work, Victima gives you that added boost to get you to where you want to be. When I take Victima, I see everyone as a racist. It really works. Watch: Ironically, FOX News fired Bob Beckel, the only liberal on the Gutfeld Show the day after this show aired, after he allegedly made a racist remark that offended a black employee working at FOX.

Mark Dice (@MarkDice) May 16, 2017 Conservative comedian Mark Dice also reminded him that his comments on a recent Jimmy Kimmel show about how it was tough to be a conservative in Hollywood, was likely the final straw that caused ABC to cancel his show: @ofctimallen You calling out the Liberals for their insanity on Jimmy Kimmel was the last straw for the Network, but someone had to do it. Thanks, Tim!  Mark Dice (@MarkDice) May 16, 2017 On March 17, 2017, Tim Allen was a guest on the Jimmy Kimmel ShowAllen told Kimmel he has to be careful around intolerant liberals in Hollywood, saying: Its like 1930s Germany! A petition was started last week by Last Man Standing fans and now has over 371K signatures. The petition asks ABC to reconsider their decision to cancel the Last Man Standing and to renew the show. Here is the LINK to that petition: The petition to ABC reads: Despite consistently high rankings, especially considering the time slot in which it is aired, Tim Allens show Last Man Standing has been cancelled by the network on which it is aired, ABC. Last Man Standing stands out in the sea of network television sitcoms. It is a show that appeals to a broad swath of Americans who find very few shows that extol the virtues with which they can identify; namely conservative values. Last Man Standing was not just selling conservative ideals though, as some of the characters in the show are clearly of the liberal persuasion, yet the characters on the show all manage to get along and take care of one another, despite their politically opposed views. The show is about more than politics though, it is about family. In fact, politics is only a secondary part of the show, but one in which many Americans can readily identify. Last Man Standing is one of the only shows on broadcast television, and the only sitcom, that is not constantly shoving liberal ideals down the throats of the viewers. And sadly, that is likely the real reason the show has been cancelled. The intent of this petition/boycott is to attempt to get ABC to renew the show. With that in mind, I will no longer be watching any ABC shows. I have cancelled the DVR settings for the other ABC shows that I regularly watch. If you want to help try to save Last Man Standing, I encourage you to do the same. Even if you are not willing to boycott the network, but still want to save the show, please sign this petition and share it. If you do plan to boycott ABC, please say so when you sign. Let them hear our voices. Now, Studio 20th Century Fox Television is looking for a new home for canceled Tim Allen comedy Last Man Standing. Speaking to Variety Thursday, studio presidents Jonnie Davis and Howard Kurtzman said that they were surprised by ABCs decision to pull the plug on the show. Thats the one thats really an open sore right now, Davis said. Kurtzman added, We really were expecting a pickup. The fact that we didnt get a pickup was a surprise and a disappointment. I think no one was more disappointed than Tim Allen, such a huge star with such a huge following. But the series, which was ABCs second most-watched comedy last season behind Modern Family, may not be dead. Asked whether Last Man Standing would be shopped to other networks, Kurtzman said, Were starting to explore that. If its not going to go forward at ABC, of course Jonnie and I are hopeful that we can find another home for it. And the studio heads are encouraged by the fan support that theyve seen for the show since ABC confirmed its cancellation last week. We know how passionate our fans are, and were seeing that now, Davis said. Political and social conservatives have been vocal in their disappointment over the shows end. Allen, its star and executive producer, is conservative and a supporter of President Trump. Speaking to reporters Tuesday, ABC entertainment president Channing Dungey denied that Last Man Standing was canceled because of Allens right-leaning politics, and said that it was, instead, a scheduling decision. Once we made the decision not to continue with comedy on Friday, it was just kind of thats where we landed, she said. Variety Time will tell if ABCs fan base is more important to them than their liberal views"

Trump Proclaims the Third Saturday of Each May as Armed Forces Day. ARMED FORCES DAY, 2017        BY THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA A PROCLAMATION For almost 70 years, our Nation has set aside one day to recognize the great debt we owe to the men and women who serve in the Army, Navy, Air Force, Marine Corps, and Coast Guard. On Armed Forces Day, we salute the bravery of those who defend our Nations peace and security. Their service defends for Americans the freedom that all people deserve. This year, we also reflect on the 100th anniversary of our Nations entry into World War I. More than 4.7 million Americans would ultimately serve in the United States Armed Forces during that terrible conflict. Their sacrifice has not been forgotten. One hundred years later, we face different threats and challenges. But our safety and security, and the defense of our way of life, rest in the same able hands of our Armed Forces. Because our Armed Forces must constantly adapt to new threats, our Nation is committed to ensuring they have the tools and resources they need as they train, deploy, and fight in defense of our country and defending our values. This is why my budget calls for a $54 billion increase in national defense spending. Today, we salute our Soldiers, Sailors, Airmen, Marines, and Coast Guardsmen for their dedication as they carry out the extraordinary duty of protecting our country. We also pay tribute to the families who serve alongside them, lending their steadfast love and support. NOW, THEREFORE, I, DONALD J. TRUMP, President of the United States of America, and Commander in Chief of the Armed Forces of the United States, continuing the tradition of my predecessors in office, do hereby proclaim the third Saturday of each May as Armed Forces Day. I invite the Governors of the States and Territories and other areas subject to the jurisdiction of the United States to provide for the observance of Armed Forces Day within their jurisdiction each year in an appropriate manner designed to increase public understanding and appreciation of the Armed Forces of the United States. I also invite veterans, civic, and other organizations to join in the observance of Armed Forces Day each year. Finally, I call upon all Americans to display the flag of the United States at their homes and businesses on Armed Forces Day, and I urge citizens to learn more about military service by attending and participating in the local observances of the day. Proclamation 9452 of May 20, 2016, is hereby superseded. IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this nineteenth day of May, in the year of our Lord two thousand seventeen, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty-first. DONALD J. TRUMP"

SAUDI GUARDS With Swords Dance And Celebrate Around Melania and President Trump [Video],['Fed Up'],2017-05-20 16:21:42+00:00,"When President Trump and First Lady Melania Trump arrived at the Murabba Palace in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia they were greeted by guards with swords dancing. President Trump received a red carpet welcome only reserved for very special guests. There were other examples of special things the Saudis did for the First Family. What stands out the most is when the king shook the First Ladies hand. A very rare occurrence indeed! The press can be nasty all they want. This trip has been a huge success so far: OUR PREVIOUS REPORT ON THE ARRIVAL OF THE PRESIDENT AND FIRST LADY: President Donald Trump and First Lady Melania Trump arrived in Saudi Arabia to rare red carpet treatment. What a great way to begin the Presidents first foreign trip that will last 9 days. Several symbolic gestures by the Saudis show a sign of respect and friendship. This is very different from when Obama went to Saudi Arabia last year and the kind didnt even come to the airport to greet him. He touched down in the Middle East this morning, hours after tweeting about his excitement for his first big foreign trip. Trump flew to the capital Riyadh overnight on Air Force One  becoming the only president to make Saudi Arabia, or any majority Muslim country, his first stop overseas as president. His arrival following a 6,700-mile flight was met with the pomp usually reserved for the likes of a Papal welcome in South America. The president got the red carpet treatment  literally  and some airport workers took off their shoes before manicuring it with brooms in 97-degree heat. Another symbolic gesture by the kingdom: There were 30 U.S. flags at the ready, a tiny fraction of the thousands that line streets and highways between the airport and the city center. The king greeted President Trump at the bottom of the stairs  a very rare scene. A 90-person Royal Saudi Air Forces honor guard practiced rifle drills and then stood at attention while Trump and his kingly escort ambled toward the terminal. Melania and Ivanka Trump seemed determine to make a statement by deplaning without head coverings. This was a rare sight among women in Riyadh whose main choices are the hijab and the niqab. The King shook First Lady Melania Trumps hand  a rare scene. Still, the first lady stayed a half-dozen steps behind King Salman and her politician-husband, escorted by a lone U.S. Marine in full dress uniform. After a welcome ceremony inside the Royal Terminal, Trump and Salman sat together in The Beast, the White Houses armored SUV that travels in the belly of Air Force One.  The first stop was the glitzy Ritz-Carlton, whose exterior is being lit up at night with giant projected images of the American flag. Trumps first overseas speech is expected to frame the global fight against ISIS and other Islamist terror groups as a battle between good and evil  but early drafts suggest he will not use the phrase radical Islamic terrorism.  He will also call on leaders in the Middle East to drive out terrorists from your places of worship. Signs of American caution are everywhere as the president who once campaigned on the strength of excluding Muslims from the U.S. ventured into the nation whose king partners in construction with the Bin Laden Group. U.S. military snipers stood guard on nearby jetways. A duplicate Air Force One 747 jet stood by, lest Trumps schedule should be waylaid by engine trouble. Read more: Daily Mail"

Kimberly Guilfoyle was one of the few women at FOX News who stood up for Roger Ailes when he was being accused of sexually harassment by former Fox and Friends host Gretchen Carlson. Guilfoyle tweeted a message of support for the Ailes family on Twitter following his death: RIP #RogerAiles sending my love and prayers to Beth & Zachary. Roger was a friend and a mentor to so many of us @FoxNews he will be missed  Kimberly Guilfoyle (@kimguilfoyle) May 18, 2017 Guilfoyle also bravely eulogized Ailes on FOX News. It was her current bosses the Murdoch boys, who fired Roger Ailes, the man who put FOX News at the top of the ratings due to allegations of sexually harassment by Gretchen Carlson and later from former FOX host Megyn Kelly: Former Fox News boss Roger Ailes was eulogized in the town of Palm Beach at St. Edward Roman Catholic church Saturday morning in a service heavy with references to suffering. Beth (Ailes wife, Elizabeth) came to me Friday and asked that I officiate, St. Edward Monsignor Thomas J. Klinzing told DailyMail.com. She asked me to base some of my reading on the theme of suffering. I believe Roger suffered quite a bit with those accusations. Klingzing was referring to Ailes firing from the network he founded last year after fired FNC anchorwoman Gretchen Carlson accused him of sexual harassment followed by other women coming forward with similar accusations. Ailes coffin was carried out at 11am to the altar of the 90-year-old church, famously President John F. Kennedys Winter White House church, as five members of the Palm Beach Police Department presented the colors. The ceremony was kept secret by Ailes family members and was attended by fewer than 100 family and friends, and took place with heavy security under the watch of three private security guards. The media guru and political strategist died on Thursday in Palm Beach, Florida aged 77. Rush Limbaugh and his wife Kathryn were in the front row. Douglas Kennedy, a nephew of JFK who works at Fox News, read from Letters of Paul to the Romans, a passage about how nothing can separate a believer from the love of God. Sean Hannity read a responsorial psalm. I wouldnt be what I am today without Roger, Hannity told DailyMail.com exclusively after the funeral. He took me as a local radio host in Atlanta and gave me the opportunity of a lifetime. He saw things in people that no one else would see. He is an American patriot of the highest level.

If you had any doubt Trump is being sabotaged by the main stream media and Washington old guards, look no furtherCoverage of President Trump is 93% negative! This is over the top! Our media and politicians are doing everything they can to destroy Trump How negative was press coverage of President Trumps first 100 days in office? Far more than that of Barack Obama, George W. Bush, or Bill Clinton, according to a new report from the Harvard Kennedy Schools Shorenstein Center on Media, Politics and Public Policy. The Harvard scholars analyzed the New York Times, Wall Street Journal, Washington Post and the main newscasts (not talk shows) of CBS, CNN, Fox and NBC during Trumps initial time in office. They found, to no ones surprise, that Trump absolutely dominated news coverage in the first 100 days. And then they found that news coverage was solidly negative  80 percent negative among those outlets studied, versus 20 percent positive. The numbers for previous presidents: Barack Obama, 41 percent negative, 59 percent positive; George W. Bush, 57 percent negative, 43 percent positive; and Bill Clinton, 60 percent negative, 40 percent positive. Accusations of bias aside, its simply a fact that a number of negative things happened in Trumps opening 100 days. The Russia investigation, for example, was a source of endless criticism from Democrats and other Trump opponents. The travel ban executive order led to intense argument and losses for the administration in the courts. The healthcare debacle created more negative coverage because it was a major screwup and a setback for both Trump and House Republicans. That said, the coverage of some news organizations was so negative, according to the Harvard study, that it seems hard to argue that the coverage was anywhere near a neutral presentation of facts. Assessing the tone of news coverage, the Harvard researchers found that CNNs Trump coverage was 93 percent negative, and seven percent positive. The researchers found the same numbers for NBC. Obama and Hillarys hero had this to say about taking down an enemy: Obama Campaign Manager and Senior Adviser had this to say about Trump last June: IT IS NOT ENOUGH TO SIMPLY BEAT TRUMP.

DEMOCRATS Poster Child For Stupidity Cant Tell MSNBC Host What Her Party Stands For Besides Hating Trump [VIDEO],['Fed Up'],2017-05-20 11:31:40+00:00,"Besides Donald Trump, the best thing that happened to the Republican Party in 2017 is the emergence of Democrat Congresswoman Maxine Waters as the self-appointed spokeswoman for her washed up political party. Every time this woman opens her mouth, it becomes comedy gold for the Republicans. What Maxine doesnt know is that while shes convinced herself that shes making strides in destroying the credibility of our current president, shes actually causing even the most die-hard Democrat to wonder why they ever supported this gaggle of fools Rep. Maxine Waters (D., Calif.) struggled Friday on MSNBC to explain what the Democratic Party stands for besides opposing President Trump. Waters has been one of the most outspoken critics of Trump in Congress, repeatedly calling for his impeachment and insisting that if investigators connect the dots, then his campaigns alleged collusion with Russia will become apparent. Given Waters public profile as a staunch Trump opponent, MSNBC host Katy Tur asked the lawmaker what Democrats actually stand for beyond opposing Trumps agenda. Congresswoman, what do the Democrats stand for other than being against Donald Trump? Tur asked. What do you stand for other than trying to get Donald Trump impeached? Everyone knows that I am the ranking member of the Financial Services Committee and that I have spent many, many hours and days implementing the Dodd-Frank reforms, Waters responded. The California Democrat proceeded to frame her work on Dodd-Frank in the context of opposing Republicans, which Tur noted. We pushed back on the Republicans, we fight against them, Waters said. [They] attempt[ed] to go get rid of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau before we came up with the reforms under Dodd-Frank. Tur pushed back. Are Democrats focusing enough on their ideas? she asked. Waters then went on to explain how effective the Democrat Party has been in their organizing efforts to disrupt town halls where Republican political leaders are speaking to their constituents. Listen, if you have not been keeping up with the town halls that have been going on, Waters said, referring to the protesters at many Republican town halls, where we have basically organized America around the [Affordable Care Act] and protected Obamacare and the thousands of people who have come out who now are very much informed about the difference between Obamacare and Trumpcare. WFB What Maxine doesnt understand is that when Tea Party members attended town hall meetings across American and challenged their elected leaders on reckless tax legislation they didnt need to be organized by the Republican Party. Tea Party members werent just targeting Democrat politicians, they were targeting anyone who they felt wasnt representing the people who elected them into office."

MINNEAPOLIS (WCCO)  Just under a month after a Big Lake trap teams photo was banned from the high school yearbook, another high school yearbook photo is making news. For its 2017 yearbook, Brainerd High School dedicated a page to President Donald Trump. Editors asked students their thoughts on the president, and shared the quotes next to their picture. One sophomore said, I would like to behead him. I do not like him. The photo went viral, sparking controversy on Twitter. Now, that student is telling her side of the story. I was so confused, because at first, I didnt ever remember saying that, 15-year-old Camryn said. Camryn  who asked WCCO not to reveal her last name  says she had no idea a conversation with a classmate last September would lead to nationwide attention. She says the classmate never said she was working for the yearbook when she asked about then-candidate Donald Trump. I did not say, I want to behead him. I did not say, I am going to behead him. I just said, Well Im sure we all wouldnt mind him being beheaded,  something along those lines, Camryn said. But there was never the direct quote, I do not like him. I would like to behead him. That conversation exploded on social media 8 months later, with the help of at least one celebrity.

Instead of a flat rate, the state would charge people depending on how much money they made. The less you make, the less you pay. State Senator Robert M. Hertzberg believes Californias traffic fines are too high, and the burden is unduly put on low-income families. Many fines, dont even get paid. California is owed almost $10 billion in unpaid traffic fines, something the state tried to chip away at with an amnesty program that would allow violators pay a fraction of what they owe.

The Smithsonians National Museum of African American History and Culture continuously collects items of historic significance from African Americans involved in all phases of American life, and the sociologist and author Harry Edwards encouraged the museum to take a close look at Kaepernick. The former San Francisco 49ers quarterback drew nationwide attention last year when he knelt during the national anthem to protest police brutality in America. In September, 2016, the union for police officers who work San Francisco home games threatened a boycott of policing the stadium after the 49ers refused to discipline Colin Kaepernick for not standing during the national anthem and for his statements about law enforcement. If the 49ers organization fails to take action to stop this type of inappropriate behavior it could result in police officers choosing not to work at your facilities,the letter reads. The board of directors of the Santa Clara Police Officers Association has a duty to protect its members and work to make all of their working environments free of harassing behavior. It also criticized what it called anti-police statements made by Kaepernick, calling them insulting, inaccurate and completely unsupported by any facts. Edwards arranged for the donation of a jersey and other equipment to the Smithsonian, but did so with a request. I said, Dont wait 50 years to try to get some memorabilia and so forth on Kaepernick, Edwards said, according to USA Today. Let me give you a game jersey, some shoes, a picture.  And it should be put right there alongside Muhammad Ali. Hes this generations Ali. Daily Wire  Adopted by white parents in Wisconsin, Kaepernick is the biological child of a white woman and a black man. He was born in 1987. Kaepernick explained his refusal to stand for the Star-Spangled Banner, expressing solidarity with the net-marxist racial narratives of Black Lives Matter: I am not going to stand up to show pride in a flag for a country that oppresses black people and people of color. To me, this is bigger than football and it would be selfish on my part to look the other way. There are bodies in the street and people getting paid leave and getting away with murder. Kaepernick describes himself as a black man in a society that oppresses black people. Kaepernicks refusal to stand for our national anthem was considered anything but brave by many of his fans. Heres a picture of a fan burning Colins jersey, a trend that was started shortly after Kaepernick used his position to promote the violent Black Lives Matter movement on the field as the other players honored our nation: Kaepernick remains unsigned even as players like Ryan Fitzpatrick sign deals, and there is, of course, the question of how much his very public and very controversial political stances may be harming his marketability.

100percentfedup,['bias'],http://100percentfedup.com/deputy-attorney-general-doubles-comey-memo-wrote-believe-stand/,Deputy Attorney General Doubles Down On Comey Memo: I wrote it. I believe it. I stand by it.,['Fed Up'],2017-05-19 18:15:57+00:00,"Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein doubled down today when he told Congress he stands by a memo he wrote that the White House has cited as a justification for the firing last week of FBI Director James Comey. In closed-door meetings with lawmakers on Thursday and Friday, Rosenstein said he wrote the memo after President Donald Trump told him one day before the May 9 firing that he wanted to dismiss Comey. He said that though he was personally fond of Comey, I thought it was appropriate to seek a new leader. The Justice Department on Friday issued a transcript of Rosensteins remarks: OPENING STATEMENT: Good afternoon. I welcome the opportunity to discuss my role in the removal of FBI Director James Comey, although I know you understand that I will not discuss the special counsels ongoing investigation. Most importantly, I want to emphasize my unshakeable commitment to protecting the integrity of every federal criminal investigation. There never has been, and never will be, any political interference in any matter under my supervision in the United States Department of Justice. Before I discuss the events of the past two weeks, I want to provide some background about my previous relationship with former Director Comey. I have known Jim Comey since approximately 2002. In 2005, when Mr. Comey was Deputy Attorney General, he participated in selecting me to serve as a U.S. Attorney. As a federal prosecutor, he was a role model. His speeches about leadership and public service inspired me. On July 5, 2016, Director Comey held his press conference concerning the federal grand jury investigation of Secretary Clintons emails. At the start of the press conference, the Director stated that he had not coordinated or reviewed this statement in any way with the Department of Justice. They do not know what I am about to say. Director Comey went on to declare that he would publicly disclose what we did; what we found; and what we are recommending to the Department of Justice. He proceeded to disclose details about the evidence; assert that the American people deserve to know details; declare that no reasonable prosecutor would file charges; and criticize Secretary Clinton. I thought the July 5 press conference was profoundly wrong and unfair both to the Department of Justice and Secretary Clinton. It explicitly usurped the role of the Attorney General, the Deputy Attorney General and the entire Department of Justice; it violated deeply engrained rules and traditions; and it guaranteed that some people would accuse the FBI of interfering in the election. There are lawful and appropriate mechanisms to deal with unusual circumstances in which public confidence in the rule of law may be jeopardized. Such mechanisms preserve the traditional balance of power between investigators and prosecutors, and protect the rights of citizens. Director Comey attended the Maryland U.S. Attorneys Office training seminar on October 27, 2016, and gave a detailed explanation of his reasons for making public statements about the conclusion of the Secretary Clinton email investigation. I strongly disagreed with his analysis, but I believe that he made his decisions in good faith. The next day, October 28, Mr. Comey sent his letter to the Congress announcing that the FBI was reopening the Clinton email investigation. He subsequently has said that he believed he was obligated to send the letter. I completely disagree. He again usurped the authority of the Department of Justice, by sending the letter over the objection of the Department of Justice; flouted rules and deeply engrained traditions; and guaranteed that some people would accuse the FBI of interfering in the election. Before the Senate Judiciary Committee on May 3, 2017, Director Comey testified under oath about his public statements concerning the Secretary Clinton email investigation. I strongly disagreed with his explanations, particularly his assertion that maintaining confidentiality about criminal investigations constitutes concealment. Nonetheless, I respected him personally. Former Department of Justice officials from both political parties have criticized Director Comeys decisions. It was not just an isolated mistake; the series of public statements about the email investigation, in my opinion, departed from the proper role of the FBI Director and damaged public confidence in the Bureau and the Department. In one of my first meetings with then-Senator Jeff Sessions last winter, we discussed the need for new leadership at the FBI. Among the concerns that I recall were to restore the credibility of the FBI, respect the established authority of the Department of Justice, limit public statements and eliminate leaks. On May 8, I learned that President Trump intended to remove Director Comey and sought my advice and input. Notwithstanding my personal affection for Director Comey, I thought it was appropriate to seek a new leader. I wrote a brief memorandum to the Attorney General summarizing my longstanding concerns about Director Comeys public statements concerning the Secretary Clinton email investigation. I chose the issues to include in my memorandum. Before finalizing the memorandum on May 9, I asked a senior career attorney on my staff to review it. That attorney is an ethics expert who has worked in the Office of the Deputy Attorney General during multiple administrations. He was familiar with the issues. I informed the senior attorney that the President was going to remove Director Comey, that I was writing a memorandum to the Attorney General summarizing my own concerns, and that I wanted to confirm that everything in my memorandum was accurate. He concurred with the points raised in my memorandum. I also asked several other career Department attorneys to review the memorandum and provide edits. My memorandum is not a legal brief; these are not issues of law. My memorandum is not a finding of official misconduct; the Inspector General will render his judgment about that issue in due course. My memorandum is not a statement of reasons to justify a for-cause termination. My memorandum is not a survey of FBI morale or performance. My memorandum is not a press release. It is a candid internal memorandum about the FBI Directors public statements concerning a high-profile criminal investigation. I sent my signed memorandum to the Attorney General after noon on Tuesday, May 9. I wrote it. I believe it. I stand by it. Finally, I want to address the media claims that the FBI asked for additional resources for the investigation of Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election. I am not aware of any such request. Moreover, I consulted my staff and Acting FBI Director Andrew McCabe, and none of them recalls such a request. END OF TRANSCRIPT The White House has struggled since Comeys firing to explain the chain of events that led to it and who exactly made the decision. Trump said as recently as Thursday that he acted on a very strong recommendation from Rosenstein, but Rosenstein made it clear to Congress that he drafted his memo only after Trump told him of his plans to dismiss the FBI director. He said he did not intend for the document to be a finding of misconduct or a statement of reasons to justify the firing, but he added: I wrote it. I believe it. I stand by it. Via: NBC Chicago"

Its pretty sickening that shes even being asked to speak at a college commencementANY college commencement! The Clinton GRIFTERS also owe the Haitian community answers on where money went after the Haiti earthquake relief effort. The Haitian community is up in arms over much that happened after the 2010 earthquake. This should be interesting: Here is how the Clintons used the money that Americans donated to help the devastated residents of Haiti to enrich themselves: On June 8, Hillary Clinton is scheduled to serve as the Class of 2017 commencement speaker at Medgar Evers College in Brooklyn, New York, where she will also be awarded an honorary degree. The announcement has incited protests from several members of the Haitian community who plan to protest the speech and are pushing the colleges president, Rudy Crew, to rescind the invitation. PANDERING TO THE BLACK COMMUNITY IN TIMES OF TROUBLE: Every time the Clintons get in a bind, they run to the black community to whitewash their tarnished image, said Komokoda, the Haitian group protesting the speech, in a statement. After Bill Clinton was impeached for lying under oath in the Monica Lewinsky affair, he brought in Jesse Jackson and a host of black preachers to lead prayers with him at the White House. To divert attention from her deleted emails debacle, Hillary had Bill DeBlasios wife, Chirlane McCray, bring her to Brownsville, one of the most impoverished neighborhoods in Brooklyn, for a photo op with little black children. When newspaper editorials and cartoons were blasting her for her unending lies and demanding investigations and prosecutions, former New York City mayor David Dinkins brought her out for a keynote speech at his Dinkins Leadership & Public Policy Forum at Columbia University. Today, for her resurrection from a shameful defeat by the last person most reasonable people felt could ever be president of the United States, the dirty work falls to Rudy Crew. HAITI RELIEF SCAM  QUESTIONS REMAIN: The Clintons role in Haiti has incited immense criticism and has tarnished their relationship with the Haitian community. In 2010, Haiti suffered a massive earthquake. Several NGOs and the United Nations flocked to Haiti to help relief efforts, but their intervention came with several costs. In 2011, UN Peacekeepers caused a massive cholera outbreak that killed at least 9,500 people and sickened 800,000 others. During this time, Bill Clinton served as the United Nations Special Envoy to Haiti while Hillary Clinton served as secretary of state. While the Clinton Foundation has staunchly defended their role in Haiti, their involvement in the country has been far from successful. Many of the most notable investments the Clintons helped launch, such as the new Marriott in the capital, have primarily benefited wealthy foreigners and the islands ruling elite, who needed little help to begin with, wrote Jonathan Katz for Politico in 2015. For Komokoda and many Haitians, the Clintons epitomize NGOs and corporations exploiting the crisis and relief efforts in Haiti for their own gain. Haitians also blame the Clintons for the controversial rule of former Haitian President Michel Martelly, who stepped down in February 2016 due to his record of corruption after the Clintons helped him get elected in 2010.

The Obama regime set the ball in motion for fair share housing or social engineering. Will our legislators be able to stop the insanity of displacing citizens who are receiving housing subsidies from our government in favor of refugees or illegal aliens? Having lived in the same flat for 16 years, a German woman is being forced to move out to make way for refugees, because building a new shelter is too expensive. The 51 year-old nurse, who has helped asylum seekers in the past, was shocked by the news. Bettina Halbey, who lives alone in the small town of Nieheim, received a letter from her landlord and the local municipality at the start of September, Die Welt newspaper reported on Thursday. I was completely shocked and I cant even begin to find the words to describe how the city has treated me, Halbey told the German publication. I have had to go through a lot of difficulties recently, and then I get this notice. It was like a kick in the teeth. Halbey will have until May 2016 to find a new place to live, along with her dog and her cat. The three-story building, where she rented a 90 sq/m flat will now be turned into accommodation for refugees, who are seeking to make Germany their new home. The mayor of Nieheim, Rainer Vidal, which has a population of just over 6,000, defended the decision to send the nurse packing, saying converting the building would be the cheapest option. A new residential unit for 30 refugees in Nieheim would cost 30,000 ($33,600). This solution will cost me nothing, he told Die Welt. Over half the population of Germany lives in rented accommodation and the country has laws to defend the rights of tenants. Normally, only a private individual can terminate the terms of a contract for personal use. A municipality cannot move into a flat as a legal entity, so the process is legally highly questionable, Ulrich Ropertz, spokesman of the German Tenants Federation, told the Telegraph. Via: RT News In Italy, an elderly gentleman in the video is Luigi Fogli, a businessman in his 80s, who runs a hotel (Hotel Lory) in Ficarolo, in the province of Rovigo, Italy. Not long ago, he inquired about providing asylum accommodation services from the local government, but chose not to pursue the matter further when he found out that he would only be paid 7 euros per refugee per night. At that point, the local prefecture simply confiscated his hotel and forced the invaders upon him. He tried to block their admission and, in fact, managed to hold it up for a few hours. But, eventually, he succumbed and the invaders arrived. Apparently he fainted at some point during the proceedings."

BREM-1M Armored Repair and Recovery Vehicle (ARRV) which entered service around 2012. 2. BTR-82A or AM Armored Personnel Carrier (APC). The BTR-82A was officially adopted in 2013 and manufactured until the BTR-82AM was adopted in 2014. The BTR-82AM project modernizes existing BTR-80 APCs instead of manufacturing completly new vehicles as was done with the BTR-82A. The BTR-82AM also incorporates several upgrades. The only way I can visually distinguish between the 2 is where the forward right side firing port of the BTR-80 is removed and a plate is welded over the location. 3. BREM-1M. 4. BTR-82A or AM in green followed by 1 in white followed by the Tor-M2D2 self-propelled air defense missile system (ADMS). This variant should still be in the trial stage as it first appeared this year, although the Tor-M2U on which it is based is in service. 5. Old WWII piece. I dont keep up with these although some have been put into service with pro-Russian separatists in the Novorussia region of Ukraine. 6. KamAZ-65225 tractor with ChMZAP-9990-0000073-02 trailer for carrying any vehicles that break down along the parade route. First appeared around 2009. 7. T-72B3 Main Battle Tank (MBT) with additional armor. First appeared on 4/5/2017. 8. BMP-3 Infantry Fighting Vehicle (IFV) (mid-production model) followed by 2 x Kurganets-25 IFVs. 9. Duplicate of photo 4? 10. 9P78-1 Transporter Erector Launcher (TEL) of the 9K720 Iskander-M ballistic missile complex. I havent fully researched it yet but believe it was adopted in 2006 with most deliveries starting in 2013. 11. Pantsir-S1 (SA-22B Greyhound-B) of the 96K6 Self Propelled Air Defense Gun Missile System. 12. BMP-K or K-17 or VPK-7829 APC  The official designation isnt yet clear but this wheeled APC is likely still in the trial stages. The Bumerang chassis is expected to be a basis for several other vehicles being developed. 13. 2S35 Coalition-SV 152-mm self-propelled howitzer. It made its appearance during rehearsals for the 2015 parade. I believe it is still undergoing trials. 14. 2S19M2 MSTA-S 152-mm Self-Propelled Howitzer. Adopted in 2012. 15. Kurganets-25 IFV. The base vehicle is used for this vehicle and the Kurganets-25 tracked APC (not photographed). They made their appearance in 2015 rehearsals and are still undergoing trials. Russia recently announced that they will not enter mass production until 2021. http://defence-blog.com/army/russia-to-start-mass-production-of-advanced-kurganets-25-combat-vehicles-in-2021.html 16.

Pantsir-S1 Air Defense Gun-Missile System. 14. 5P85SE Transporter Erector Launcher (TEL) of the S-300PMU air defense missile system. Im dont have a high degree of confidence in this ID. Could be another S-300 series but I dont believe this one is an S-400. 15. BMP-K or K-17 or VPK-7829 Bumerang wheeled APC. 16. ,17  Possibly either medical services, Military Automobile Inspectorate (VAI), or 1 medical followed by 1 VAI vehicle. SA-17: 9A317 x 4 followed by at least 2 x Tor-M2U. YARS: Note that the ICBMs are accompanied by AMN-233114 Tigr-M with Arbalet-DM vehicles. These and other vehicles such as the BMPD Typhoon-M Anti-Sabotage Fighting Vehicle (not in the parade) conduct route reconnaissance and security for the mobile ICBMs of the Strategic Rocket Forces."

wordpress,"['bias', 'conspiracy']",https://russiamil.wordpress.com/2017/03/17/new-gerasimov-article-on-nature-of-warfare/,New Gerasimov article on nature of warfare,['Dmitry Gorenburg'],2017-03-17 00:00:00,"Valery Gerasimov, the Chief of the Russian General Staff, has published a new article on the nature of modern warfare. Given how much attention has been paid to his 2013 article on this topic, it seems worthwhile to quickly review whats changed in the last four years. The most important observation, though, is how much hasnt changed. Gerasimov still focuses on the American origin of hybrid warfare, both attributing the origin of the term to American theoretical writings and discussing its implementation in the Middle East, and particularly in Syria. Gerasimovs discussion of the origins of the conflict in Syria is worth citing at length. He notes that in the first stage, internal Syrian tensions were transformed into armed actions by the opposition. The opposition was supported by foreign trainers and an active information war from abroad. Subsequently, terrorist groups supplied and organized from abroad then entered the conflict against Syrian government forces. The conclusion that Gerasimov draws is that hybrid warfare is actively practiced by the United States and other NATO members, in large part because this type of action does not fall under the definition of aggression. Nevertheless, Gerasimov isnt eager to assume that the hybrid warfare concept is here to stay or to introduce it into official Russian discourse. Instead he focuses (as in the 2013 article) on the continuing erasure of the boundary between conditions of war and peace. He highlights that it is more and more common for a countrys sovereignty and national security to be threatened in peacetime. The spectrum of reasons for use of military force is continually expanding, with force being more often used to secure a states economic interests or to enforce democratic values in another country. Much of this is a repeat of the 2013 argument, with the focus on Western states using a wide spectrum of measures (political, economic, diplomatic, informational) combined with the protest potential of the population, to ensure that their interests are observed. Cyber warfare is added to this list, with an example of cyber attacks on Iranian energy infrastructure. What seems interesting to me is the second half of the article, where Gerasimov discusses how Russia is responding to this heightened risk of new generation warfare. Here, Gerasimov drops all the discussion of hybrid and information warfare. Instead, his focus is very much old school: a discussion of strategic deterrence with nuclear weapons and long range aviation. To this is added the development of long range cruise missiles and other precision-guided munitions, next generation fighter aircraft, modern ships, etc. There is also a discussion of advances in automation and electronic warfare. In other words, Russia is preparing to respond to this threat environment by strengthening its conventional and nuclear military capability. There is virtually no discussion of Russian efforts to engage in information warfare or hybrid warfare of any kind. Little green men play no role in this vision of Russian military power. Instead, we are given to understand that Russia will respond to any aggression with overwhelming force. Advertisements"

Im reposting it here. Lots of other very interesting memos are available on the PONARS website. - Russian foreign policy is driven by the political elites search for a new basis for national self-esteem after the collapse of the Soviet Union disrupted old Soviet identities. The collapse did not discredit the Soviet Unions status as a great power, which has thus remained a core aspiration for Russian political elites. As a result of their perception of Russias appropriate status in the world and in their region, they have also sought to maintain Russias role as a guiding force among the newly independent states that formerly made up the Soviet Union. This combination of Russia as a global great power and regional hegemon is seen as providing the ruling elite with a source of legitimacy with their domestic constituency. Most of Russias immediate foreign policy goals are focused on its immediate neighborhood. These include maintaining friendly or at least compliant governments in neighboring states and, failing that, keeping unfriendly neighboring governments weak and off balance. All of this is placed in a global context because in addition to securing its periphery, these goals also serve to prevent encroachment by Western states in Russias desired geographic sphere of influence. Beyond these overarching goals, Russian leaders are focused on ensuring Russias domestic stability, territorial integrity, and sovereignty. These are primarily defensive goals that seek to ensure the survival of the state and its ruling elite in their current form, rather than aggressive goals that seek to expand Russias territory or its sphere of influence. Most of Russias military and security policies are designed to secure the state and its current territory against potential attacks and to counter the threats that Russian leaders see facing their country. Moreover, Russian leaders do not really have a well-developed strategy on how to achieve this in their immediate neighborhood. Instead, they have a toolkit of political and military tactics and are open to opportunities to use this toolkit. Russias Threat Perception The main threats to Russian security, as identified by Russias political and military leadership, are spelled out in the most recent edition of the countrys military doctrine announced in December 2014 (see the English translation of the doctrine). According to these guidelines, the most serious military risk that Russia faces is the expansion of NATO. The potential of NATO enlargement to include former Soviet republics has been seen as a threat by Russian leaders for many years, with concern about Ukraine and Georgia resulting in Russian involvement in conflicts in both of those countries. While this concern remains uppermost in Russian leaders minds, in recent years they have also come to focus on the expansion of NATO military infrastructure in existing member states near Russias borders. The doctrine accordingly identifies military risks associated with bringing the military infrastructure of NATO member countries near the borders of the Russian Federation and with the deployment (build-up) of military contingents of foreign states (groups of states) on the territories of states contiguous with the Russian Federation and its allies, as well as in adjacent waters, including for exerting political and military pressure on the Russian Federation (Russian Military Doctrine, 12a and 12c). The 2014 military doctrine was the first official document to highlight the military threat posed to Russia by externally organized regime change. In recent years, this has been repeatedly mentioned as the most serious threat facing the Russian government, but it had not previously been portrayed as a military threat. By mentioning the destabilization of the situation in individual states and regions and undermining of global and regional stability and the establishment of regimes whose policies threaten the interests of the Russian Federation in states contiguous with the Russian Federation, including by overthrowing legitimate state administration bodies as external military risks, Russian leaders highlighted their perception that regime change originates in secret plans organized abroad, primarily by the United States and its allies (Doctrine, 12b and 12m). These plans, Russian leaders argue, include a number of aspects. The establishment of hostile regimes in neighboring states through the destabilization of legitimate governments is seen as being part of a campaign to eliminate Russian influence over neighbors that are of vital importance to Russias security. In addition, Russias adversaries are willing to sow chaos in foreign states in order to create excuses to intervene and establish pro-Western governments there. Finally, even though these efforts mostly take place outside Russia itself, their ultimate goal is to weaken the Russian government in order to create an opportunity to replace the Putin regime with one more amenable to Western dictates. In addition to military and political means to achieve these goals, Russian leaders are concerned about the use of information warfare to weaken Russian sovereignty, political independence, and territorial integrity (Doctrine, 12l). This is part of an overall emphasis on internal threats and the role of state policy in countering Western interference in Russian domestic affairs. A third set of security risks faced by Russia concern threats to its nuclear deterrence capability. Missile defense remains at the top of this list, as Russian leaders do not believethat the United States can make a credible commitment to refrain from using such defenses against Russias nuclear deterrent capability. They are convinced that if the United States were able to develop an effective and financially viable form of defense against ballistic missiles, domestic political pressure would result in it being expanded to counter Russian missiles, regardless of any promises that the leaders of the United States might make in the interim that missile defense is aimed only against rogue states such as Iran and North Korea. Russian leaders concerns about threats to Russian nuclear deterrence capabilities have in recent years moved beyond missile defense to include a variety of new technologies, such as the Prompt Global Strike concept for the development of conventional strategic precision-guided munitions and weapons fired from space. The 2014 military doctrine adds these weapons to the list of military risks faced by Russia (Doctrine, 12d). As with missile defense, the concern is that the United States might use such weapons to eliminate Russian nuclear deterrent capability, rendering it defenseless against a NATO or U.S. attack. Finally, Russian leaders express a genuine concern about the threat posed to Russia by radical Islamist organizations. This concern is usually articulated through the discussion of global terrorism and extremism. The Russian military doctrine highlights the links between radical international armed groupings and inter-ethnic and inter-confessional tensions in the context of a lack of effective international anti-terrorist cooperation (Doctrine, 12j and 12k). The significance of this concern for Russian leaders is highlighted by its choice as the main theme of the 2016 Moscow Conference on International Security. Given Russias recent history with Islamist insurgency in the North Caucasus and terrorist acts committed throughout Russia by extremists over the last 20 years, Russian leaders recognize the potential for a renewed wave of attacks to destabilize the Russian state. As is usually the case, the Russian military doctrine does not mention any threats posed by China. Ostensibly, this is because Russia considers China a strategic partner rather than a potential threat. Nevertheless, Russian experts regularly discuss the potential long-term risk of Chinese designs on Russian territory in the Far East and regularly contemplate the short-term danger of Russia becoming excessively dependent on China and being reduced to a Chinese junior partner and energy supplier. Furthermore, the Russian military regularly conducts exercises that are designed to counter a land invasion by a major power in the Far East and Siberia. Although no country is mentioned as the target of these exercises, China is the only country that could threaten Russia with a land invasion from the east. Overall, in recent years, Russian leaders have become more concerned about the threats they feel are emanating from NATO and the United States. In the aftermath of the Arab Spring and especially after the electoral protests that took place in Russia in 2011-12, they started to emphasize the danger to Russia posed by externally fomented domestic protests and regime change. These combined changes in Russian threat perceptions contributed to a serious deterioration in Russias relations with the West even before the Ukraine conflict erupted in 2014. Western planners need to keep in mind that Russian leaders see Russia as weaker than its adversaries and very much on the defensive. This does not preclude a concurrent belief that Russia needs to be proactive and to initiate conflict when critical state interests are threatened and opportunities to seize the initiative present themselves. As a result, Western observers often see Russia as having an aggressive and revanchist mindset, even as Russian leaders perceive their actions as aimed entirely at shoring up their vulnerable security position. Regional Priorities Russian foreign policy remains focused on Europe and the United States. Since the international system remains centered on Euro-Atlantic institutions, Russias drive for respect in the international system and the geographic proximity of its main population centers to Europe means that Europe remains the primary geographic region of focus for Russian foreign policy. Russian interests in Europe are both economic and political. Economic interests are related primarily to energy sales, while politically Russia seeks to weaken European institutions in order to work bilaterally with individual states. Russias second area of concern is its vulnerable southern border. Russian policy in Central Asia and the Caucasus has in recent years been shaped by three divergent perspectives: 1) great power competition in the region, which leads Russian politicians to view the regions problems through a geopolitical and military lens; 2) energy, with a focus on securing exclusive rights for gas and oil transit from the region to Europe; and 3) concern about transnational security threats, such as radical Islamism, terrorism, and drug smuggling. The internal tension among these perspectives has been the main source of inconsistency in Russian policies in the region. Depending on which perspective is in ascendance, Russian officials alternate between a) focusing on soft security threats, which are best dealt with through the development of cooperative mechanisms with states both in and outside the region, and b) taking steps to limit the influence of outside states in the region as part of an effort to retain a monopoly on energy transit and to come out on top in its rivalry with the United States. In recent years, with the fading of U.S. involvement in Central Asia and the decline in energy prices, Russia has become more focused on ensuring that the region is ruled by friendly regimes and supporting their efforts to prevent internal uprisings and infiltration by Islamist extremists. In recent years, the Middle East has become more important for Russian foreign policy. Russias key goals in the region are to reduce instability while increasing its own influence and reducing that of the United States. Russian leaders see U.S. policies that promote democratization as being the main cause of chaos and instability throughout the region. At the same time, Moscows interests in the Middle East have clearly benefited from overreach by the United States. Russia has worked to use local dissatisfaction with the conduct of the Iraq war and U.S. support for popular protests against local autocrats to restore some of the influence it lost in the Middle East after the collapse of the Soviet Union. The Russian operation in Syria has done even more to this end, showing that Russia has the interest and resources to be a serious player in the region. The establishment of a permanent military presence in Syria over the last year has further increased Russian influence in the Middle East, to the extent that some analysts argue that Russia now has a commanding position in Syria and perhaps in the region as a whole. Russias involvement in the Middle East is fraught with risks as well. The de facto Shia alliance with Iran, Iraq, and Syria has led to tension with Gulf states and (in the recent past) with Turkey and also brings Russia into direct confrontation with ISIS, potentially exposing it to a higher risk of terrorist attacks against Russian interests and/or on Russian territory. Finally, Russias turn toward Asia has so far been expressed more in rhetoric than in actual policy. Russian elites are starting to realize that Asia matters in its own right, not just as an adjunct or counterbalance to the West. But so far they have been more adept at recognizing the importance of Asia than in developing effective strategies for engaging with it. In part, this is because old stereotypes of Asia as inferior still dominate. But mostly it is because it is hard to reconcile the pursuit of Russian security and economic interests in Asia with the Russian political elites Western-centric worldview. Even in Asia, U.S. behavior in large part determines how Russia responds, since containing and balancing the United States is one of the key missions of Russian foreign policy around the world. This stems in large part from Russian leaders belief that Russia can be a global power only by limiting the influence of the United States. In Asia, it has tried to do so (with limited success) by building an anti-hegemonic consensus with China and India. At the same time, despite the currently positive relations with China, Russian leaders remain concerned about Chinas increase in power and long-term intentions, particularly given Chinas efforts to develop the Silk Road project. They worry that China could replace Russia as the dominant other in U.S. foreign affairs, leaving Russia marginalized. For this reason, despite ongoing tension with the United States, Russian leaders are not averse to having the United States work to constrain Chinese ambitions in Asia and around the world. On the whole, Russian objectives in Asia are preventative in nature: containing the United States and China, maintaining Russian influence in the region, and eroding US-led alliances without destabilizing the region, all while staying out of local conflicts. Conclusion The election of Donald Trump as president of the United States is unlikely to change Russias strategic calculus. Russia will continue to seek to maximize its status in the world, possibly by proposing a deal where the United States recognizes its sphere of influence in its immediate neighborhood in exchange for a more cooperative relationship globally. Such a trade would legitimize Russia as a global great power while avoiding the need to expend scarce resources on a global fight for influence with the United States. Advertisements"

Go read the whole thing, which also includes contributions from a number of other scholars. - Donald Trumps victory has the potential to fundamentally reshape U.S.-Russian relations, but whether such a realignment will actually take place will depend on how Trump chooses to learn and appreciate the past failures of several U.S. attempts to engage Russia. It remains to be seen whether he will be willing to follow the advice of professionals, or if he will strike off on his own. U.S.-Russian relations are founded on a complex history, with structural differences among national elites that will prove difficult to bridge through personal rapport among the national leaders. Trumps first problem will be that other than a small number of close advisers who share his instincts to engage Putin, most of the policy establishment is likely to hold hardened views of Putins Russia, ranging from distrustful to confrontational. Rapid change is unlikely to come quickly, despite the personal attention of the president-elect, because the bureaucracy will initially take an obstructionist position. Having said that, we can make a few predictions regarding policy initiatives that are likely to be undertaken by President Trump. First of all, he is likely to restore the full range of government contacts, including between the two countries military establishments. Second, he will pursue more extensive cooperation with Russia in Syria, against ISIS but also against other anti-Assad groups that could conceivably be described as Islamist. Most likely there will be a complete abandonment of the existing policy formulation that there is a moderate Syrian opposition and viable alternatives to Assad, which will closely bridge the U.S. position with that of Moscows. And finally, the active sanctions policy against Russia is likely to end, though existing sanctions will not be lifted without a quid pro quo. .. Click here to read the rest of the article.
